    "Please typeset your derivations in LaTeX, so that you can print your notebook and turn it in. You may also email your notebook to me.\n",

    "1. Beginning with Gauss's law, show that the electric field produced by a thin sheet of charge with surface charge density $\\sigma_q$ is given by $E(z) = \\sigma_q / 2\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Derive an expression for the vertical profile of the electric field produced by an inifinitely wide slab of charge with thickness $H$ whose bottom is at a height of $z_0$ and has charge density $\\rho$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Complete the two function below, as described by their documentation strings (docstrings).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Plot the electric field profile in 2. using a charge density of 1 nC/m$^3$, bottom height of 5 km, and thickness of 1 km.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plot the electric field profile produced by an inifinitely thin layer of charge (in isolation) at a cloud top height of 8 km for a surface charge density of .001 nC/m$^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Plot the electric field profile produced by an inifinitely thin layer of charge (in isolation) at a cloud bottom height of 1 km for a surface charge density of .001 nC/m$^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Taking into account the conductivity difference of the cloud $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{cld}}$ and the clear air $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{clr}}$, use eq. 2.4 to find an expression for the top and bottom surface charge densities. Assume that the ratio $\\alpha = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{clr}}/ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{cld}}$ of clear and cloudy air conducitivites is constant with height.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Plot the actual electric field of the combined cloud having characteristics given by problems 4â€“6.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Show that your expression for 7. reduces to that given by MacGorman and Rust Eq. 2.5 for an infinitely thin cloud: the surface charge densities have equal and opposite sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Show that your code tends twoard equal and opposite surface charge densities at the upper and lower boundaries as the cloud becomes thinner."
